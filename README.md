# module21

This was a very interesing module because it tests all the components we have learned so far. We have to define the typedefs to tha very schema of the db to get this projeect working. Eirk was a huge help in this because as it reviwed all the previous subjects, he was able to point out where things needed to be changed or removed all together. He was really helpful in getting someon like me to understand the concepts.

The boo serch is not reallly complicated, but it does require a bit of thought and planning. Erik was able to help me put this together and get the starter code intergrated really well with the projcet as a whole.

I dont think I could have done this without him!
